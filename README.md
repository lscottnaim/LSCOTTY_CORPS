# LSCOTTY_CORPS
## Repository for LSCOTTY Corps mock python tasks

You have been tasked by LSCOTTY Corp. to produce a quiz with the following features:
- The quiz has 10 different questions (of your choice)
- The user should be able to input an answer
- The answers should be case INSENSITIVE
- The quiz should tell the user if they get it right or wrong
- The quiz should keep score and tell the score at the end
- The code should be written in Python
- The code should be commented
- The code should have as little duplication as possible

The final quiz should be pushed to GitHub in the form of a PR request from your created branch (e.g. je-quiz-task) to main

**Do NOT commit straight to main**

## Tips
- Use a loop
- Use a counter
- Consider variable types
- Google is friend
- Write your code in plain english first and then write it in bits e.g. *if the user get the answer right, add 1 to the score*
- Make small commits and squash and merge at the end
- Ask if you get stuck :)
